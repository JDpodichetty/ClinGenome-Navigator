## Technical Architecture

### Knowledge Graph RAG Implementation

**Entity Extraction:**
- Clinical notes processing for medical entity identification
- Genetic variant mapping and relationship creation
- Laboratory value integration with clinical context

**Relationship Mapping:**
- `causes_kidney_dysfunction` - Links genetic variants to kidney problems
- `elevates` - Connects conditions to lab value increases  
- `correlates_with` - Identifies clinical associations
- `influences_kidney_function` - Tracks genetic impact on kidney metrics

**Query Processing:**
1. Natural language pattern recognition
2. Knowledge graph relationship traversal
3. Precise patient cohort filtering
4. LLM-enhanced clinical interpretation
